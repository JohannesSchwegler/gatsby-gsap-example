# Gatsby + GSAP example

Since there is no official gatsby plugin and there is no even clean starter for GSAP and Gatsby, I initiated this repo to be some kind of example.

## Issue

[You can check the issue here](gatsby-gsap-example.netlify.app)

When you get to the site for the first time, you can see the SVG is "blinking" before GSAP triggers the animation. I hope to fix this so I count on help from community.
It only happens when you serving site. on `gatsby develop` its working fine.
