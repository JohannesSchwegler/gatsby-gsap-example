## Issue

You can check the issue here: gatsby-gsap-example.netlify.app

When you get to the site for the first time, you can see the SVG is "blinking" before GSAP triggers the animation. I hope to fix this so I count on help from community.
It only happens when you serving site. on `gatsby develop` its working fine.
